      <div class = "heading">Basic Driving</div>
      <p>Robot will be able to do basic forward backward driving.</p>
      <div class = "heading">0 Point Turn</div>
      <p>Robot will be able to perform a 0 point turn. This is an advanced rotational maneuver that allows the robot to turn turn in place without moving and needing to drive around in a circle. This is especially useful for improved mapping and staying put in closed spaces. 
          The most common place you've probably seen zero point turns is on high end lawnmowers which can be very useful for navigating tight spaces.</p>
      <div class = "heading">Sensors</div>
        <p>Sensors will be present on the robot to detect obstacles so it does not run into them and so it can react accordingly.</p>
    <div> class = "heading">Routing</div>
        <p>Robot will have mapping capabilities and be able to decide a route and follow it precisely through its steering functions. This means that the robot will be able to accurately go from one point to another and avoid obstalces in the process.</p>
