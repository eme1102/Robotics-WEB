      <div class = "heading">Basic Driving</div>
      <p>Robot will be able to do basic forward backward driving. Due to the tank-like treads steering and turning the wheels is not really possible. Instead alternate method are used to rotate while not giving up the advantages of having treads that can traverse any terrain.</p>
      <div class = "heading">0 Point Turn</div>
      <p>Robot will be able to perform a 0 point turn. This is an advanced rotational maneuver that allows the robot to turn turn in place without moving and needing to drive around in a circle. This is especially useful for improved mapping and staying put in closed spaces. 
          The most common place you've probably seen zero point turns is on high end lawnmowers which can be very useful for navigating tight spaces.</p>
      <div class = "heading">Pressure Sensors</div>
        <p>Pressure sensors will be present on the front and back of the robot to detect obstacles it bumps into so it can drive around them. After bumping into something it's code will have it rotate and move until it avoids any nearby obstacle.</p>
      <div class = "heading">"Vision" Sensors</div>
        <p>Sensors will be mounted on the center on the robot to help detect where obstacles are and minimize collisions. The sensors will act as a sort of pair of eyes for the robot and help it detect and appropriately react to obstacles.</p>
      <div class = "heading">Routing</div>
        <p>Robot will have mapping capabilities and be able to decide a route and follow it through its steering functions. This means that the robot will be able to accurately go from one point to another. It will know its position on the path at all times so when it runs into
        an obstacle it will be able to move around it through utilizing sensors and then go back to the path at the nearest point possible.</p>
