    <p>Project MonoTread is a prototype vehicle that utilizes a compact drivetrain to simulate
    tracked mobility in a scaled-down format. The build is currently a work in progress and 
    contiunes to evlove with each testing phase. This robotic may have one tread but it's able to do tasks like a normal tank could do. For starters the gears that help 
    project monotread move would be a 30 gear piece,an 18 gear piece,an 12 gear piece,6 gear piece also using 30 gear piece helping the first chain motioning the second
    chain and with that the tread moves.</p>
